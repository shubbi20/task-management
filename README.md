## features
- User Authentication: JWT-based authentication to secure API endpoints.
- Role-Based Access Control: Admins have full control, while regular users have restricted access.
- Task Management: Create, update, view, and delete tasks with various status controls.
- Search and Filter: Filter tasks based on title, status, and due date.
- Middleware: Custom middleware for authentication and authorization.

- Postman Collection: A Postman collection is included in the repository to easily test the API.
- Written tests using Jest for user-service, covering maximum test coverage.
